Einstein wrote a riddle last century. He said that 98% of the world could not solve it.

   * There are 5 houses in five different colors.
   * In each house lives a person with a different nationality.
   * These five owners drink a certain type of beverage, smoke a certain brand of cigar and keep a certain pet.
   *  No owners have the same pet, smoke the same brand of cigar or drink the same beverage.

The question is: Who owns the fish?
